### Logger Test

- **GET /loggerTest** - Test the logging functionality by generating logs of different levels

## Logging

This project uses Winston for logging with different configurations for development and production environments. 

### Development

- Logs all levels from `debug` to `fatal` to the console

### Production

- Logs levels from `info` to `fatal` to the console
- Logs levels from `error` to `fatal` to a file named `errors.log`

## Error Handling

Custom error handling middleware is implemented to provide consistent error responses and logging.

## Running the Project

1. Run `npm run start` for development
2. Run `npm run build` and then `npm run start:prod` for production

## Testing

To test the endpoints, you can use tools like Postman or Insomnia. Here's some sample product data you can use to test the `/products` endpoints:

```json
{
  "title": "Sample Product",
  "description": "This is a sample product.",
  "code": "ABC123",
  "price": 100,
  "status": true,
  "stock": 50,
  "thumbnails": ["http://example.com/image1.jpg"]
}
